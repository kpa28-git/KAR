# Alias
Crossplatform shell aliases for linux and bsd, pick and choose which ones to load in your shell profile file.

## Requirements
The `posix.sh` file must be loaded first. All other alias files are optional and can be loaded in any order.

## TODO
* make this a git submodule of config
* separate branches for different distros and OSes
